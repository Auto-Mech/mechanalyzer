# RateFit

Module deal with rate constant functional forms; Either
 (1) fits a set of rate constants [k(T, P)] to
     various functional forms
 (2) calculates k(T, P) using a functional form given the
     fitting parameters are known.

Supported Functional Forms:
 1. Modified Single- and Double-Arrhenius
 2. Lindemann
 3. Troe
 4. PLog 
 5. Chebyshev
