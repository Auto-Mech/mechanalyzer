REACTIONS     CAL/MOLE     MOLES

! This includes one pair of geometric diastereomers: 
! 1. C4ALK-808sWvZ and C4ALK-808sWvE
! and two pairs of enantiomers:
! 1. C4KEOH-RyFn3YA1 and C4KEOH-RyFn3YA0
! 2. C4ADOH-q3bFNeA1 and C4ADOH-q3bFNeA0 

! Also, there is a weird species (Sarah found) with two optical diastereomers, one of which has a pair of enants but the other doesn't
! 1. C4CETH-RvEsWvAB (has no enant!) with diastereomers C4CETH-RvEsWvAA1 and C4CETH-RvEsWvAA0 (which are of course enants of each other)

! Also, adding two sets of full optical diastereomers to simulate Sarah's second weird case:
! 1. C4CEHY-2m1jatAA0 and C4CEHY-2m1jatAB0 and C4CEHY-2m1jatAA1 and C4CEHY-2m1jatAB1
! 2. C4CEHY-Y2VjatAB0, C4CEHY-Y2VjatAA1, C4CEHY-Y2VjatAA0, and C4CEHY-Y2VjatAB1

! To test Sarah's first weird case, where one diastereomer doesn't have an enantiomer

C4CEHY-2m1jatAB0 = C4CEHY-Y2VjatAB1      2.00E+12     0    0  ! these two are the slow, non-unioned path
C4CEHY-2m1jatAB1 = C4CEHY-Y2VjatAB0      2.00E+12     0    0
