REACTIONS     CAL/MOLE     MOLES

! This includes two pairs of stereoisomers: 
! 1. C4ALK-808sWvZ and C4ALK-808sWvE
! 2. C4CETH-RvEsWvBB0 and C4CETH-RvEsWvAB

! Four stereo reactions with stereo species in both reactants and
! products. They should be condensed to a single reaction (with the rates
! taken as the sum divided by 2)
C4ALK-808sWvZ + HO2 = C4CETH-RvEsWvBB0 + OH      1.00E+12     0    0
C4ALK-808sWvZ + HO2 = C4CETH-RvEsWvAB + OH       2.00E+12     0    0
C4ALK-808sWvE + HO2 = C4CETH-RvEsWvBB0 + OH      3.00E+12     0    0
C4ALK-808sWvE + HO2 = C4CETH-RvEsWvAB + OH       4.00E+12     0    0

! Two (nonsense) reactions to check when there is only a single 
! stereoisomer in the *products*. They should be condensed to a single 
! reaction (with the rates *averaged*)
H + HO2 = C4CETH-RvEsWvBB0 + OH      3.00E+12     0    0
H + HO2 = C4CETH-RvEsWvAB + OH       4.00E+12     0    0

! Two (nonsense) reactions to check when there is only a single 
! stereoisomer in the *reactants*. They should be condensed to a single 
! reaction (with the rates *added*)
C4ALK-808sWvZ + HO2 = H + OH      1.00E+12     0    0
C4ALK-808sWvE + HO2 = H + OH      2.00E+12     0    0

! Two non-stereo reactions. They should be unchanged
H + OH = H2O    1.00E+12    0   0
